# Basics

There are no uppercase letters in Modena, only lowercase letters.

Punctuations like the exlamation mark `!` and the question mark `?` are not used in Modena because they are not needed: they can be expressed using words.

The only punctuations that we have is to make writing explicit in situations where oral doesn't have that issue:

* The `.` (period) allows writing to separate sentences.
* The `-` (dash) allows dialogues to be written clearly.

Note that unlike English, and like French, spaces always surround punctuation marks.

Commas are not used because sentences are already clear without them in Modena.

Quotes are not used either, because Modena has words to express them. (TODO: what word? Like ko ... ok?)

There is also no italic or bold in Modena, but underlined text is allowed (and encouraged).
