# What?

Modena removes ambiguity as to what is the object complement in a sentence by using the construction "ko ... ok".

For example:

"I like apples"

in English translates to 

"jo sarang ko pome ok"

in Modena.

* jo: I
* sarang: like
* pome: apples

## Complex sentences

Some sentences can be really hard to parse in english. For example:

"I like the blue car that you gifted me the day before we met your parents."

In Modena, you can use two things:

* linkers: "la" instead of "ok" to make the object complement the subject of the next part of the sentence.
* pointers: to refer to complements of previous sentences, you can use label and point to them.

So using pointers you could deconstruct the previous sentence as:

* the day before we met your parents you gifted me a blue car
* I like this blue car

or using linkers: (direct voice?)

* I like the blue car
* the blue car was a gift 
* the gift happened the day before we met your parents

Let's introduce the vocabulary first:

* I: jo
* to like: sarang
* blue: azul
* car: tram
* to gift: cado

then in Modena the previous examples translate to:

* pointers: 
* linkers: jo sarang ko tram azul la cado la ...
